A simple music player application built using HTML and CSS and BootStrap.

Only raw concepts of HTML and CSS are used here to build this webpage.

1- Index.html file contains the basic structure of the page with all the elements, classess and parent-child relationships.

2- style.css file contains the basic styling of the page and all the elements within.

3- Playlist.html file conatins more information and songs related to any artist that has been selected (For now, i have created only one static page for COLDPLAY BAND
which can be further extended to create pages for all the artists).
